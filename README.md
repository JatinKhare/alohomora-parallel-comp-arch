# Motivation

Extracting performance from present dayâ€™s multi-core systems is a very challenging task. One of the major difficulties that arise are due to synchronization. Synchronization is used to guarantee correctness, but it also forces parts of the code to be serialized. In this project, we present a comprehensive study of various mutual exclusion techniques.

This repository contains the codes for lock using:

1. CAS
2. TAS
3. FAI
4. Ticket Lock
5. Anderson Lock
6. MCS Lock
7. NUMA-aware Lock
